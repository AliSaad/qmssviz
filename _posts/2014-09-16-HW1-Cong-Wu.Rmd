##Summary
#Data Set:  NFL regular games 2014.
This data set contains data of 8174 games in 2014, displaying records on Date, Visitor team name, Visitor Score, Home team name, Home score, Line and Total Line
```{r}
regular = read.csv("regular.csv")
summary(regular$Visitor)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
