This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
cars
dd <- read.csv("Donation-Disease.csv")
dd2 <- data.frame(dd)
head(dd2)
dim(dd2)

library(MASS)
data(ChickWeight)
head(ChickWeight)
dim(ChickWeight)

library(ggplot2)

help(ggplot)

ggplot(dd)
ggplot(ChickWeight)

d <- ggplot(data=data3, aes(x=MonthNB, y=Ptot, colour=StationNAME))

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
