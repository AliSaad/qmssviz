This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:



```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.'


install.packages("ggplot2")
require(ggplot2)
?chickwts
cwt <- chickwts
cwt
#groups <- aggregate(cwt$feed, 
?aggregate

aggregate(cwt$weight ~ cwt$feed, FUN="mean")
ggplot(cwt, aes(x = weight, fill=cwt$feed)) + geom_dotplot(binwidth = 20) + ylab("Count") + xlab("Weight") + ggtitle("Chicken Weight by Type of Feed")


```
