### 1. read data

```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/qmssviz/Lab1")
dd <- read.csv("Donation-Disease.csv")
```

### 2. draw charts

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(x = Name, y = Death, data = dd, color = Name)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
