###I acquired this data from the package UsingR which includes a long list of data sets that are clean and easily accessible.  I have chosen to use the data set "batting" which includes variables such as homeruns, at bats, RBIs, strikeouts, etc.  The first thing that occured to me was to examine the relationship between homeruns and strikeouts.  

```{r,figure2, fig.height=8, fig.width=6,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, error=FALSE, fig.keep='all', fig.show='asis'}
library(ggplot2)
library(UsingR)
qplot(SO, HR, data = batting, geom = c("point", "smooth"))
```

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
qplot(SO, HR, data = batting, geom = c("point", "smooth"))
```

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
qplot(teamID, HR, data = batting, geom = "boxplot")
```
