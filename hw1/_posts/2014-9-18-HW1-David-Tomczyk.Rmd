My first foray into R and ggplot2

---



```{r ggplot, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, message=FALSE}

setwd("~/qmssviz/Labs/questionnaire")
respo <- read.csv("responses-2014-09-05.csv",stringsAsFactors=F)
program <- respo[2]

library(ggplot2)

qplot(x=factor(Program), data=program, geom="bar", fill=factor(Program))

```

What I like:  
-Its my first graph in R/ggplot2

What I don't like:  
-The colors  
-I wish the x axis labels were more spread out, or just gone 
-The x axis titles should simply be "Program"  
-I think I'd like to order the data, though I'm not sure how  
-The colors
