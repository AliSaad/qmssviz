First I created an object called "Academic Data" that was built out of my csv file. Then I imported it into r.
```{r, read-data}

Academic_Data <- "../../Academic Data.csv"
academic <- read.csv(Academic_Data)
```
####Next I looked to see the names of the columns/variables
```{r, look_at_variable_names}
head(names(academic), 10)
```
####Then I defined two of the variables as new objects
```{r, define_variables}
X12_13ELA <- academic$X2012.13.NYS.ELA.Test
X12_13Math <- academic$X2012.13.NYS.Math.Test
```

```{r, plot}
plot(X12_13ELA, X12_13Math, 
     xlab='English Scores', 
     ylab='Math Scores', 
     main='2013-14 New York State Test Scores')
```
####Finally I plotted them. Voila!
